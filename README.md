# Identity

The Metaverse is all about one's **identity** in a non-physical world. This identity must be interoperable and unique between spaces.

# Will to Explore
Metaverse spaces must give users different elements to allow them to be eager to explore. A space might be all about games whilst another could be about exclusive cosmetic items.

# An Expansion

Since the Metaverse is about one's **identity** , it must also communicate with traditional Internet platforms as well as the real world. A Metaverse Identity could have as much of a social presence as a physical identity.

# Built From Bottom and Up

The Metaverse must be built with the most used technology in order to be accessible by as many as possible. That said, it must be built using web and mobile friendly technology before porting to high-end devices such as VR.

# Technical Document

In order to be interoperable, there must be a technical document with specifications for how different platforms should be able to connect to each other regardless of device, hosting servers or engine. Any platform must be able to read a player Identity.
